### Built with

### What I learned

With this challenge I learned how to implement flexboxes, learned more about css grids and the advantages of mobile first workflow. It was an amazing way to apply in a more practical approach everything I've been learning so far.

### Continued development

This project helped implementing the things I had already learned from HTML and CSS but it also made me seek knew knowledge and discover different ways of doing what I already knew. It was an experience that made me interested in discovering different features and workflows to better my code. As a beginner I want to also learn more javascrip in order to feel confident enough to implement it in projects like this one.
